## Design and Development
- Simple MVC structure (Model-View-Controller).
- Lightweight HTML/CSS frontend.
- Deployment with Docker

---

## Unique Approaches
- Parsed text into objects with regex from chatgpt response (Just like when developing an AI Agent)
- Minimalist backend, no heavy frontend frameworks.
- Focus on nostalgic fnaf atmosphere over complexity.
- ## Easter eggs. (Make sure to send Golden Freddy atleast 6 messages!)

---

## Development Trade-offs
- No advanced user authentication or session management.
- Basic mobile responsiveness only.
- Optimized for small to traffic, not large-scale use.

---

## Known Issues
- No input validation for very long messages.
- Search API doesn't display pictures as intended due to links given by the API being invalid.
- Coldstart due to free hosting.

---

## Why This Tech Stack
- **Java Spring Boot**: Stable, powerful, great cloud support + great for server side.
- **Maven**: Standard for Java dependency management.
- **Google Cloud Run**: Easy deployment, auto-scaling without infrastructure management.
